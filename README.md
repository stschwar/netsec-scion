SCION for Android
====

A fork of the [Netsec-SCION](https://github.com/netsec-ethz/netsec-scion) repository. For more information on SCION read the [original README](https://github.com/stschwar/scion/blob/termux-modifications/README-orig.md) or visit https://www.scion-architecture.net.

This fork specifically focuses on implementation of SCION on Android devices. Since it currently is mainly developed for Linux environments and its code base is based heavily on both [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Go](https://golang.org/), to make it run on Android devices the [Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app) app project is used.

Termux is an open-sourced Android app that emulates a Terminal off an Arch-Linux environment. For more information on Termux, visit the [Project website](https://termux.com/) or the corresponding [Wiki](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Main_Page).

[Download Termux App from Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux)
